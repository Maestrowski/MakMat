      "description": "My interest for programming developed when I was in college. At first I was interested in web development having seen all the possibilities and ways I could have an impact on the world. Over the years, I have developed several websites and continued to develop my skills. My development comes at around the same time as the rise of artificial intelligence which particularly excites me because with AI there are even more possibilities. Lately I developed a AI stock market predictor which is presented in a web application and that is only the beginning."
